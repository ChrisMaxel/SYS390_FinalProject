General
===========
   Introduction
   --------------
   The purpose of this document is to explore the system requirements for the ARCO Hub church management software. 
   The goal of ARCO Hub is to be able to provide a platform in which classes offered by the church are managed in a more efficient manner. 
   This will allow for students and teachers to benefit from a system that is better able to handle their needs.
   Their current model of using an Excel spreadsheet to handle all of the data is not able to sufficiently support the volume of students and classes offered. 
   ARCO Hub will alleviate this problem as well as improve ease of use.
   
   Users
   --------------
    Student: The student is the lowest level in the hierarchy of those who have an account. 
    They will be able to view courses and sign up for those in which they meet the prerequisite requirements. 
    Additionally, they will be able to use the messaging system and view the calendar.
    
    Teacher: This account is in the middle of the  hierarchy of privileges. 
    In addition to the abilities of students, teachers are able to manages the classes in which they are the teacher. 
    They are able to mark attendance as well as who has paid the course fee.
    
    Administrator: This account is at the top of the hierarchy. In addition to the privileges of the previous account types, they have full ability to view and modify classes, 
    callendar data, and messages.
    
    Collaborating Software
    -------------
    WhatsApp: In order for teachers to communicate with their students, 
    a third party messaging software will be integrated. It will be able to be used by teachers, students, and administrators at their own discretion. 
    It will transfer text as well as potentially pictures.
    
    Home Group Software: Information from database will need to be imported, but direct integration is not required.

    Logical Data Model
    -------------------------

    Data Dictionary
    ---------------------------
        The Data Dictionary is a detailed description of the entities and attributes of the Logical Data Model. 
        In addition, one can find relationships between entities laid out here as well as information about how the new database will interact with the current homegroup database.

        (PK) = Primary Key
        
        (FK#) = Foreign Key

        ### Member
			Represents the users/accounts that exist in the system. This entity already exists in the homegroup database and will be very central to both applications. 
			It will maintain all of the relationships within that database as well as the additional relationships listed below.

            Relationships:
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the member_personal_attr entity.
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the session entity.    
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the class_section entity.    
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the class_section_member entity.    
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the document entity.    
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the announcement entity.    
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the message entity.    
                - Has a one-to-many relationship with the attendance entity.
            Attributes:
                - id (PK)
                - first_name
                - last_name
                - email
                - phone_number
                - gender
                - birthday
                - baptism_status
                - marital_status_id (FK)
                - how_did_you_find_out_id (FK) - a key that provides information on how someone found out about a home group.
                - is_a_parent
                - join_date
                - is_active

        Any additional attributes given to a member will be handled through the member_personal_attr and personal_attr entities.

        ### Meeting 
			Represents the date and time that meetings, events or classes will be held. This entity also already exists in the homegroup database.

            Attributes:
                - id (PK)
                - date
                - time
		

        ### Member_personal_attr
