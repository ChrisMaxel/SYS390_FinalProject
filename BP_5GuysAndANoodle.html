Introduction - Spencer
===============

    Purpose
    ---------------
    The purpose for this business proposal is to provide Arco Church with several solutions in order to better 
    manage the classes that they provide to the community. The primary goal is for users to be able to join 
    classes and view details of said class as well as for teachers to manage the classes they are to instruct.
    
    Once a user signs up, they will be limited to taking the introductory course. Once they are finished with 
    that course, a variety of others will open up for them to be able to take. There will also be a method of 
    sending messages between students and teachers in order to answer questions or communicate other various 
    pieces of data.
    
    It is the intention of Five Guys and a Noodle to to suggest the best possible solution for Arco Church. 
    Should that solution be a new system built from scratch, it is our goal that at the most basic level, we 
    adhere to Crosby’s four absolutes of quality in order to ensure the best possible product. Firstly, it 
    is our intention to conform to the requirements that were given by Arco Church. It is also our intention 
    to create a quality product by preventing errors from occurring in the first place rather than seeking 
    out the source of the error after it has been implemented. Thirdly, our standards for performance are 
    held at zero defects. Even one defect prevents the product from being the highest quality that it could 
    be. Finally, non conformance to requirements is how we intend to measure quality. Should one of the 
    requirements not be met, what is the cost to fix it?
    
    This document will outline the requirements of this application and show how we intend to meet said 
    requirements. Specifically, it will provide details of alternative solutions that could be selected in 
    lieu of a custom one should that prove to be the more productive route.

    Problem Definition
    ------------------
    Arco Church’s current method of managing classes is not sufficient for their needs. 
    A more robust system that is capable of handling more data in a more streamlined and error resistant 
    manner is required. This application will be designed to fix that problem. It will increase the ease 
    of users to sign up for classes as well as make the process for teachers to manage their students and 
    class material more simple. It will decrease time required to sign up for and manage classes as well 
    as increase ease of use for all parties involved.



Customer Details - Hapner
================
	Our customer is Arco Church, a Christian organization based out of Cuenca, Ecuador. 
	The church began in 1987 under the name Verbo Ministries and has since grown to a congregation of over 2,000 members. 
	As the customer, they are also the primary stakeholder for this application.
	Our team interfaced primarily with Jonathan Guido and his brother, Joel Guido. 
	Jonathan serves as an administrator for the Arco’s facilities and Sunday morning services, and Joel serves as an executive pastor. 
	Both of their main tasks involve carrying out the vision of the church’s elders.
	Development of the application will begin in Spring of 2019 by students of the Information Systems Design course. 
	Initially, there will be no monetary cost associated with the labor of students. However, 
	all expenses incurred, such as obtainment of servers or ongoing maintenance of these servers, will be funded by Arco Church.


    Customer Mission
    -----------------
		Arco is a church that is passionate to bring the name of Christ to the world and even more passionate about growing as a unified church body. 
		Their statement of vision is “to grow together in covenant relationship under the Lordship of Jesus Christ,” 
		and their statement of purpose is “to fulfill our individual and corporate calling to bring God’s love to the world through evangelism, discipleship and loving service.” 
		Today, they use several ministerial avenues to carry out their mission, one of which is the Global Engagement Center. 
		This center was formed through a partnership with Taylor University over ten years ago and mutually serves to both grow the church 
		and provide cross-cultural opportunities for Taylor students. 
		The application that Arco Church is requesting (and we are proposing) will help to meet their current vision of simplifying the processes within the church.

Non-Customer Stakeholders - Hapner
=========================
	Non-customer stakeholders include any individual or party, outside of the previously stated customer, that will be affected by the outcome of this proposed application. 
	These stakeholders can (and will) have varying levels of involvement in the decision making and development process surrounding this application.
	
	Teachers
	--------------------
	Teachers in charge of classes offered by Arco will now have a centralized system to manage class information. 
	Once the teachers get over the learning curve of our application, they will be able to easily see statistics about their class and track attendance. 
	In addition, teachers will be able to communicate easily between students of the class. 
	This system will save a lot of hassle and time for teachers that are currently relying on basic excel worksheets to track important data.

	Students
	--------------------
	Students will be able to view and sign up for classes online. 
	No longer will they have to repeatedly ask about questions like “what is that class about again?” or “which classes do I need to take before I take that class?” 
	All class descriptions will be readily available to them. Moreover, teachers will not have to worry about students signing up for classes they are ineligible for. 
	Prerequisites will be tracked and an extensive history of completed classes can be viewed at any time by a student.

	Church Members
	-------------------
	Every church member will be given the opportunity to create an account for this application. 
	Although the application is mostly built as a class management system, 
	it will still provide features like a calendar and public message board that will contain important information about church services and events.
	
	The General Public
	-------------------
	The general public will be indirectly benefited by this application. 
	By freeing up their time and simplifying a lot of their processes, the church will be given ample opportunity to allocate more resources to the public.
	
	5 Guys and a Noodle
	-------------------
	Our team will be affected by this project through the experience gained, relationships formed, and time spent in development.

	
Problem Analysis - Caleb
================

    Situation Description
    ---------------------
	Arco Church currently is in need of an application that will allow church members to attend classes and keep track of their progress much more efficiently. 
	Their current method of course management  is using a localized spreadsheet, 
	this makes keeping track of member attendance and class progress difficult as multiple teachers and students have to record or  report their numbers to the church. 
	When it comes to taking courses, members do not have much of aid when it comes to choosing courses they qualify for. 
	Teachers also have a difficult time keeping track of members who have or have not paid for the course. Overall, 
	the process of teaching and attending classes could use much needed simplification and centralization.
	
	The environment around Arco Church speaks primarily Spanish and may not be as adept with technology as our team is. 
	This may possibly lead to disconnects between the church technology and the local congregation. 
	There is a high need for a positive user experience and simplicity too keep members engaged. 
	Because of recent church attendance rates, attention has been brought to the need for recording and potential analysis of rates and reasons why members are coming or leaving. 
	The need for more smooth communication between church leaders and administrators has also been brought to light during our situation analysis. 
	Having a platform where administrators could communicate easily would be a huge benefit when it comes to planning events or spreading general information.

Solution Alternatives - Maxel
=====================

    Proprietary Solutions
    ---------------------
	###	[Breeze](https://www.breezechms.com)
	
		Breeze is a church software management system, that charges monthly, no matter the size of the church, that can help members quickly look up people of the church. 
		The leaders can organize and communicate with groups.  Admins can track and generate reports.  This software is aimed at small to medium churches. 
		While simple breeze does not have much power, meaning that it will not be able to handle a church if it starts growing bigger.
		 
	### [Servant Keeper](https://www.servantpc.com/)
	
		Servant Keeper is an application that is intended to be used in the church, specifically with a small budget.  
		It has an impeccable homepage with charts and detailed statistics to view ministry health. 
		It has a solid user interface that is easy to use and customize to the user’s liking. 
		It has unique grouping tools that allow for mass emails and attendance tracking.  The application as a whole is greatly equipped but is generally dull.
		  
	### [Moodle](https://moodle.org/)
	
		 Moodle is a learning platform that has a focus built around effective teaching.  
		 Moodle supports multiple languages, account hierarchy, class tracking and progress, a calendar, and many more features.  
		 It is open source meaning modules and add-ons can be created and implemented.  
		 Communication through this application is weak and lacks a good messaging user interface.

	### [Blackboard ](https://www.blackboard.com/about-us/index.html)
	
		Blackboard is a tool with the intended use of education. 
		This product could  accomplish some of the wants we are pursuing. 
		It has a variety of tools that have a weak user interface that can often be confusing. 
		Blackboard has a great deal of functionality but not of high quality and user-friendliness.

    Custom Build Options
    --------------------
	###  Custom Build
	
		A custom approach allows the customer to pick and choose features to satisfy desired wants. 
		Having a custom home page that connects and uses data (such as calendar events) from their other web pages is a considerable advantage 
		as it is an add-on to what is already in place. Custom builds can allow for the growth of the church to reach their desired numbers and fix long-term issues. 
		A custom option allows a hierarchy of roles to be set up as needed. Data will be displayed in the ways required for a functional and usable form with a focus on attendance. 
		The current system that is already in place can be integrated into the new custom build management tool. 
		Communication is a highly sought after portion of this application, having the ability to share information efficiently is a high priority for this custom build.
