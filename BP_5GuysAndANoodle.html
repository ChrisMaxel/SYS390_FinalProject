Introduction
===============
    Purpose
    ---------------
    The purpose of this business proposal is to provide Arco Church with several solutions to better 
    manage the classes that they provide to the community as well as have a centralized, event-planning 
    hub. The primary goal is for users to be able to join classes and view details of said class as well
    as for teachers to manage the classes they are to instruct. The secondary goal is for administrators 
    to be able to add announcements and events that are available for all users to see.

	It is the intention of Five Guys and a Noodle to suggest the best possible solution for Arco Church. 
	Should that solution be a new system built from scratch, it is our goal that at the most basic level, 
	we adhere to Crosby’s four absolutes of quality to ensure the best possible product. Firstly, we intend 
	to conform to the requirements that were given by Arco Church. It is also our intention to create a 
	quality product by preventing errors from occurring in the first place rather than seeking out the 
	source of the error after it has been implemented. Thirdly, our standards for performance are held at 
	zero defects. Even one defect prevents the product from being the highest quality that it could be. 
	Finally, non-conformance to requirements is how we intend to measure quality. Should one of the 
	requirements not be met, what is the cost to fix it?

	This document will outline the requirements of this application and show how we intend to meet said 
	requirements. Specifically, it will provide details of alternative solutions that could be selected 
	in place of a custom one should that prove to be the more productive route.


    Problem Definition
    ------------------
    Arco Church’s current method of managing classes and planning events is not sufficient for their needs. 
    A more robust system that is capable of handling more data in a more streamlined and error resistant 
    manner is required. It is our goal to provide the customer with the best possible solution to fix that 
    problem. Our solution will increase the ease of users to sign up for classes, make the process for 
    teachers to manage their students and class material more simple, and provide easy-to-learn tools for
	planning and publicizing events. Additionally, it will decrease the time required to sign up for and 
	manage classes and increase ease of use for all parties involved.


Customer Details
================
	Our customer is Arco Church, a Christian organization based out of Cuenca, Ecuador. The church was founded
	in 1987 under the name Verbo Ministries and has since grown to a congregation of over 2,000 members.  
	As the customer, they are also the primary stakeholder for this application.  Our team interfaced 
	primarily with Jonathan Guido and his brother, Joel Guido.  Jonathan serves as an administrator for 
	the Arco’s facilities and Sunday morning services, and Joel serves as an executive pastor.  Both of 
	their main tasks involve carrying out the vision of the church’s elders.  

	Development of the application will begin in Spring of 2019 by students of the Information Systems 
	Design course. Initially, there will be no monetary cost associated with building the application. 
	However, all expenses incurred, such as obtainment of servers or ongoing maintenance of these servers 
	will be funded by Arco Church.

    Customer Mission
    -----------------
		Arco is a church that is passionate to bring the name of Christ to the world and even more passionate 
		about growing as a unified church body. Their [statement of vision](https://www.arcoministries.org/copia-de-core-values-1) 
		is “to grow together in covenant relationship under the Lordship of Jesus Christ,” and their 
		[statement of purpose](https://www.arcoministries.org/copia-de-history) is “to fulfill our 
		individual and corporate calling to bring God’s love to the world through evangelism, discipleship 
		and loving service.” Today, they use several ministerial avenues to carry out their mission, one of 
		which is the Global Engagement Center. This center was formed through a partnership with Taylor 
		University over ten years ago and mutually serves to both grow the church and provide cross-cultural 
		opportunities for Taylor students. The application that Arco Church is requesting (and we are proposing) 
		will help to meet their current vision of simplifying the processes within the church.

Non-Customer Stakeholders
=========================
	Non-customer stakeholders include any individual or party outside of the previously stated customer 
	that will be affected by the outcome of this proposed application. These stakeholders can (and will) 
	have varying levels of involvement in the decision making and development process surrounding this application.
	
	Teachers
	--------------------
		Teachers in charge of classes offered by Arco will now have a centralized system to manage class 
		information. Once the teachers surpass the learning curve of our application, they will be able to 
		easily see statistics about their class and track attendance. In addition, teachers will be able to 
		communicate easily between students of the class. This system will save a lot of hassle and time for 
		teachers that are currently relying on basic excel worksheets to track essential data.

	Students
	--------------------
		Students will be able to view and sign up for classes online. They will no longer have to repeatedly 
		ask questions such as “what is that class about again?” or “which classes do I need to take before 
		I take that class?” All class descriptions will be readily available to them. Moreover, teachers will 
		not have to worry about students signing up for classes in which they have not met the prerequisites. 
		Prerequisites will be tracked, and an extensive history of completed classes can be viewed at any time 
		by a student.

	Church Members
	-------------------
		Every church member will be given the opportunity to create an account for this application. Although 
		the application is mostly built as a class management system, it will still provide features such as a 
		calendar and public message board that will contain relevant information about church services and 
		events.
	
	The General Public
	-------------------
		This application will indirectly benefit the general public. By freeing up the church's time and 
		simplifying many fundamental processes, the church will be given a more significant opportunity 
		to allocate more resources to the public.
	
	5 Guys and a Noodle
	-------------------
		Our team will be affected by this project through the experience gained, relationships formed, and time 
		spent in development.


	
Problem Analysis
================
    Situation Description
    ---------------------
		Arco Church is currently in need of an application that will allow any individual to attend classes 
		and keep track of their progress more efficiently. Their current method of course management uses a 
		localized spreadsheet. This makes keeping track of member attendance and class progress difficult as 
		multiple teachers and students have to record or report their numbers to the church. When it comes to 
		taking classes, members do not have much readily-available information on which classes they are eligible 
		for. Teachers also have a difficult time keeping track of members who have or have not paid for the 
		course. Overall, the process of teaching and attending classes could use much-needed simplification 
		and centralization.

		Additionally, Arco Church has expressed a need for an event-planning hub. Currently, most of their 
		announcements are made during the church services in a face-to-face manner. If a church member needs 
		a reminder about where an event is taking place or at what time the event is taking place, he or she 
		must contact someone in the church and ask. Having an available calendar and public message board that 
		any user can go online and quickly see would greatly simplify this process.

		The population around Arco Church speaks primarily Spanish and may not be as adept with technology 
		as our team is. This may lead to disconnects between the church technology and the local congregation. 
		There is a high need for positive user experience and simplicity to keep members engaged. Because 
		of recent church attendance rates, attention has been brought to the need for recording and potential 
		analysis of rates and reasons why members are coming or leaving. The need for smoother communication 
		between church leaders and administrators has also been brought to light during our situation analysis. 
		Having a platform where administrators could communicate easily would be a huge benefit when it comes 
		to planning events or spreading general information.

	10. Keep member and staff information secure.



Solution Alternatives
=====================

	Custom Build Options
    --------------------
		###  Custom Build
			A custom approach allows the customer to pick and choose features to satisfy desired wants. 
			Having a custom home page that connects and uses data (such as calendar events) from their 
			other web pages is a considerable advantage as it is an add-on to what is already in place. 
			Custom builds allow for the growth of the church to reach their desired numbers and fix 
			long-term issues. A custom option allows a hierarchy of roles to be set up as needed. Data 
			will be displayed in the ways required for a functional and usable form with a focus on 
			attendance. The current system that is already in place can be integrated into the new custom 
			build management tool. Communication is a highly sought after portion of this application, 
			having the ability to share information efficiently is a high priority for this custom build.

    Proprietary Solutions
    ---------------------
		###	[Breeze](https://www.breezechms.com)
		
			Breeze is a church software management system that charges monthly, no matter the size of 
			the church, and can help members quickly look up other members of the church. The leaders can 
			organize and communicate with groups. Admins can track and generate reports. This software 
			is aimed towards small to medium-sized churches. While simple, breeze does not have much potential
			for growth - meaning that it will not be able to handle a church if it starts to grow in size.
			 
		### [Servant Keeper](https://www.servantpc.com/)
		
			Servant Keeper is an application that is intended to be used in the church, specifically 
			with a small budget.  It has an impeccable homepage with charts and detailed statistics 
			to view ministry health. It has a robust user interface that is easy to use and customize 
			to the user’s liking. It has unique grouping tools that allow for mass emails and 
			attendance tracking.  The application as a whole is greatly equipped but is generally dull.
			  
		### [Moodle](https://moodle.org/)
		
			 Moodle is a learning platform that has a focus built around effective teaching. Moodle 
			 supports multiple languages, account hierarchy, class tracking and progress, a calendar, 
			 and many more features.  It is open source meaning modules and add-ons can be created 
			 and implemented.  Communication through this application is weak and lacks a good 
			 messaging user interface.

		### [Blackboard ](https://www.blackboard.com/about-us/index.html)
		
			Blackboard is a tool with the intended use of education. This product could accomplish 
			some of the wants we are pursuing but at a pretty extreme expense. It has a variety of tools that
			have a weak user interface that can often be confusing. Blackboard has a great deal of
			functionality but not of high quality and user-friendliness.

    Cost-Benefit Analysis
    ---------------------
    <!-- ![Figure [Testies]: Testies ](https://www.google.com) --> 
		Only numbers particular to each option are in the NPV to show the cost differences of each option 
		exclusively. None of these options generate any benefits in a dollar amount (revenue) because they 
		are all providing a service of intangible benefits for the church; therefore none of the NPV tables 
		show any benefit numbers. We’re assuming that all options will need a similar number of maintenance 
		hours to keep the app running efficiently, so the numbers for routine maintenance are not part of 
		the NPV table either. In a separate maintenance table, we guessed around five hours a week would be 
		required to keep everything in the system running efficiently, which works out to 260 hours a year. 
		Then we pulled the typical salary in Ecuador for a Software Developer from online sources and calculated 
		their hourly wage. From there, we multiplied hours by the wage and got a yearly maintenance cost 
		of $3,250 for all options.

![Figure [MaintenanceCalculation]: Maintenance Calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisMaxel/SYS390_FinalProject/master/imagesForBP/MaintenanceCalculation.jpg)

		Considering the KTDA, the Custom Build option comes out on top by a decent margin, primarily because 
		it is being designed specifically to the customer’s needs. With a 100 out of 100, the custom build is 
		designed to allow for zero defects in fulfilling the customer's requirements. Moodle is second at 83, 
		losing points because it has no integration feature for current data and has no web page to view for 
		non-registered users outside of a simple log-in screen. Blackboard, Breeze, and Servant Keeper are all 
		below 70. These three options all lost points partly on account of a lack of an English to Spanish 
		translation, the most significant want in the KTDA by a large margin.

		For the NPV calculations, all numbers should be an entirely accurate cost for the option (excluding taxes) 
		outside of Blackboard, because Blackboard does not disclose costs until contacted directly by the customer. 
		The custom build option has the smallest deficit/cost (as mentioned earlier, all options come out as 
		deficits because no option involves generating any revenue). The custom build initial investment figure 
		is a development cost, generated from numbers given to us by Professor Bauson, that comes out to $1,440. 
		The custom build annual cost comes from a US server cost that runs at $15 a month. All other options have 
		a lower NPV (higher cost) than the custom build option.


	Budget Differences
	------------------
		The Custom Build option is financially better than all other options in a five-year estimate or longer. 
		All options show savings over the Custom Build option initially because no other option includes a 
		development cost. However, due to lower yearly expenses, the Custom Build option is cheaper in a five-year 
		(or longer) period than any other option. In fact, in a five-year period, the Custom Build option is over 
		$500,000 cheaper than Blackboard.

Recommendation
===============
	From the personal analysis of the team members of 5 Guys and a Noodle, we would recommend that the buyer
	choose the custom build option that we have laid out in this business proposal. This custom build will fully satisfy
	all the requirements of the customer and is the most cost-friendly option. However, as a team of Taylor University 
	students with limited professional experience, we may not deliver software that will be equivalent to that of a 
	professionally established software company.  If an issue for the buyer is time and they are willing to compromise
	effectiveness for time through buying a pre-built application, we would recommend Moodle as it scored the second 
	highest (83) on the KTDA.
